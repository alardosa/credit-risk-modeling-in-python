Dependent Variables and Independent Variables

Dependent Variables - outcomes of interest

Independent Variables - Predictors/Features

PD Model
Dependent Variable for our model - loan status

LGD Model
How much loan was recovered after default?
Dependent Variable - Recovery Column

EAD Model
total recovered principal column

Depending on the type of data we would apply different Preprocessing techniques

1. Discrete 
		Categorical
		Finite Number of Values
			Some variables take discrete values but can be treated as continuous variables in our dataset Ex: Number of Credit Inquiries in last six months is one such example
			If the discrete values are sufficient and are ordered we can treat them continuous 
		
2. Continuous
		Numerical
		Infinite Number of Values
		
Distinctive Feature of the PD model 
	All the independent variables have to be categorical
	Reason - It is much easier to present the model in a simplified form and turn it into a scorecard if we only have categorical instead of mixed

Discrete Values into Categorical
	So we would transform the discrete variables into categorical variables or dummy variables
	Only when we reach a final version of the categories from discrete values, we would create dummies
	

Continuous Variables can also be transformed into dummy variables
Ex: Annual Income, No. of Credit Inquiries in last six months 
We will start by turning each of them into many categories of equally sized intervals

Fine Classing
		Ex: No. of Months since loan has been granted <- column
		We will slice it into 50 intervals 
		like 
		1 to 3, 
		4 to 6 
		7 to 9 months upto 50
		
		Now on these categories we try to understand how do they discriminate with adjascent categories
		For example if 1 and 2 we merge them etc.
Coarse Classing
		If we make categories which are not equally distributed
		We make them using coarse classing
