Individuals 
	Credit Cards		-- 75%
	Consumer Loans		-- 75%
	Mortgages 			-- 35%
Firms
	SME					
	Large Corporations
	
Large Corporations are very less to have a  statistical data to model
SME contains enough data to build statistical models
Reatil loans are also plenty to get the data

In this course we would focus on a general case where 
enough data is available for implementing a traditional statistical methodology to build credit risk model

PD - Logistic Regression
LGD - Beta Regression
EAD - Beta Regression

For different classes of customers we may have different data available
Individuals - 
- Any Demographics or Social informations Available
- external credit risk agency data
- No. of inquiries made for credit
- Interest Rate

Credit Card - 
				Credit Limit 
				Credit Limit Utilization can be used to build model
				
Mortgage Loan - 
				Loan To Value Ratio

Corporate Loans - 
				Firm's Size
				Years in business
				Line of Operation
				Target Market focus
				Financial Statements
				Return on Assets - 	Net income/Total Assets
				Return on Equity - 	Net Income/Shareholder's equity
				Current Ratio - 	Current Assets/Current Liabilities	
				Debt Ratio - Total Liabilities/ Total Assets

Many of these informations are available 
- before the application 
- collected after the loan is granted and under a period of observation

Both of these could be used to build a behaviour model.

Two models could be made
1. Application Model
	If the loan is risky it would have a higher interest rate
2. Behaviour Model
	Whether to grant an additional loan or not;
	Ex: Using the credit card details bank may use for building the model

In this course we would be building statistical models
PD - Logistic Regression (Binomial Logistic Regression)
LGD and EAD - Beta Regression

We would be using Python
