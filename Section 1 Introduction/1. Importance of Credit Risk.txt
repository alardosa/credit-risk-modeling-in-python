Important concepts  mentioned in this section

1. **Credit** -
	Credit Card and Home loans are two very good examples of credit given to a borrower by a lender
	Money in a credit card is not ours, we need to pay it back. If we fail to pay it, we need to repay with interest.
	Home loans are another type of credit given. For this we have a collateral i.e. home itself, this could be used to recover money if the customer fails to pay back.
	Asset financing is another good example of credit. Organizations don't buy the assets at one go instead they finance it and pay it over the time.

2. **Credit Risk** -
	Likelihood that the borrower wouldn't repay their loan to the lender is credit risk.
	Collection costs are the costs incurred in recovering back the money that was not collected.
	
3. **Default Event** - 
	The event of a borrower not being able to repay their debt is called default. 

4. Risk Based Pricing
	Lenders need to assess the credit risk associated with every loan they are giving to the borrower.
	To ensure that the borrower pays back the amount he has taken, lenders could ask for
	1. Collators
	2. Increase the interest on the loan

5. Main reasons for serious finacial crisis 
	Lending to borrowers with a high probability of default
	Ex: Global Financial Crisis and Fall of Leeman Brothers
