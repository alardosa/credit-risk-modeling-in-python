BASEL II Approaches

EL = PD x EAD x LGD

BASEL II Accord has three pillars
1. Minimum Capital Requirement
	- Credit Risk
	- Operational Risk
		* Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRB)
			** Foundational IRB Approach
			** Advanced IRB Approach
	- Market Risk
	
2. Supervisory Review
3. Market Discipline

From this we have three options to model the credit risk
1. Standardised Approach
2. Foundational IRB Approach
3. Advanced IRB Approach

Capital Requirement is calculated differently under these three approach
1. Standardised Approach -- Fixed % of the total exposure
		FICO 
		Moody's etc do credit risk rating
		In India - CRISIL
		S&P do it for Firms and Countries ex: AAA, AAA-, BBB etc
		
		Under this approach,
		There is a table for which there is a certain % of total amount is held
		Ex: 
		AAA to AAA- rated companies -- 20%
		A+ to A- -- 50% should be held as capital
		
		Retail, Credit Card and Consumer loans - 75% of the loan given
		Home Loans - 35%
		
2. Foundational IRB & Advanced IRB Approach 
		When banks give out the loans they collect data and this data could be used for calculation
		This data can be used under IRB approach

Banks would like to move from SA to F-IRB to A-IRB
Because holding as much as 75% of the data of the loan is too much
If a bank gets a proper risk profile of an individual, they would need to hold less amount of money

More Precise estimation of Capital ==> More new business with SAME capital

IRB Approach allow banks to do their own credit rating
- Hence bank ccan allocate more resources to cover losses
