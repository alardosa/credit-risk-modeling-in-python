Expected Loss and it's components
EL - Expected Loss
PD - Probability of Default
LGD - Loss Given Default
EAD - Exposure At Default

Lenders know and expect the possibility of borrower not paying back

Factors of expected loss
1. Borrower-specific factors
2. The economic environment

How to estimate expected loss or expected credit loss?
Definition: The amount a lender might lose by lending to a borrower

EL = PD x LGD x EAD

Probability of Default - Borrower's inability to repay their debt in full or on time

Loss Given Default - The proportion of the total exposure that can't be recovered by the lender at default event

Exposure At Default - Total value that a lender is exposed to when a borrower defaults

Example
Cost of House - $500,000
Lender Funds 80% Loan to Value 
So loan amount -  $400,000

Borrower pays back $40,000
Borrower Defaults here.

So remaining amount to be recovered - $360,000
Exposure at default - $360,000

If there is an empirical evidence of one in every 4 homeowners having default
So,
Probability of Default = 1 out of 4 = 1/4 = 25%

Here Bank can sold the house of $342,000
Now 
Exposure at Default = $360,000 - $342,000 = $18,000

Loss Given Default = $18,000/$360,000 = 5%

Expected Loss 	= PD x LGD x EAD
				= 25% x 5% x $360,000
				= $4,500
